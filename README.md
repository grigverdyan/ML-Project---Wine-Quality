    Goal of the Project:

Predicting the Quality of Wine using Machine Learning Algorithms for Regression Analysis, Data Visualizations and Data Analysis.

Here we will predict the quality of wine on the basis of giving features. The dataset I used is also in this repository. This dataset has the fundamental features which are responsible for affecting the quality of the wine. I used classification techniques to check further the quality of the wine i.e. is it good or bed.

    Dataset description:

In this dataset, classes are ordered, but it was not balanced. Here, red wine instances are present at a high rate and white wine instances are less than red.

These are the name of Features from the dataset -:

    1.type
    2.fixed acidity
    3.volatile acidity
    4.citric acid
    5.residual sugar
    6.chlorides
    7.free sulfur dioxide
    8.total sulfur dioxide
    9.density
    10.pH
    11.sulphates
    12.alcohol
    13.quality
